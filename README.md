# _Super Galactic Age Calculator_

#### _An application that calculates the age of a user based on a planet's solar years._

#### By _**Kate Trahan**_

## Description

_This is an application that uses JavaScript to take the age of a carbon based life form and convert that number of years on Earth to the number of solar years on a different planet. The application converts the number of years on Earth to the number of years on Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. The application also can determine how many years the user has left to live on each planet based on the life expectancy on Earth. Created 2/9/2018._
