#### _An application that calculates the age of a user based on a planet's solar years._

#### By _**Kate Trahan**_

## Description

_This is an application that uses JavaScript to take the age of a carbon based life form and convert that number of years on Earth to the number of solar years on a different planet. The application converts the number of years on Earth to the number of years on Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. The application also can determine how many years the user has left to live on each planet based on the life expectancy on Earth. Created 2/9/2018._

| **Accepts person's age(earth)**| "24" | "24" |
| **Coverts age into seconds**| "24 years" | "x seconds" |
| **Determines difference between two dates**| "2/9/2018(seconds) - 2/8/2018(seconds)" | "x seconds"|
| **Returns age of a human in Mercury years** |"24 earth years"| "x Mercury years"|
| **Returns age of a human in Venus years** |"24 earth years"|"x Venus years"|
| **Returns age of a human in Mars years** | "24 earth years"| "x Mars years"|
| **Returns age of a human in Jupiter years** | "24 earth years" | "x Jupiter years"|
| **Outputs life expectancy of Earth years**| "72 years"|"72 years"|
| **Converts life expectancy on Earth to life expectancy on Mercury** | "72 years" | "x years" |
| **Converts life expectancy on Earth to life expectancy on Venus** | "72 years" | "x years" |
| **Converts life expectancy on Earth to life expectancy on Mars** | "72 years" | "x years" |
| **Converts life expectancy on Earth to life expectancy on Jupiter** | "72 years" | "x years" |
| **Determine how many years the user has to live based on life expectancy subtracted form current years** | "x years life expected on mars - current year" | "years left to live" |

## Functionality to be included in the future

* _Create an app that tells you happy birthday on your planet birthdays_
* _Let you connect to Facebook and type in your friends birthdays to tell them happy birthday on different planets(will not notify users like FB..because that gets annoying)_
